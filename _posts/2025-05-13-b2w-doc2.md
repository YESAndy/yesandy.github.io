## Sensor Communication
The data flow in B2W is built on CycloneDDS which is the basis for ROS2. As I am more familiar with ROS1, here I show how to subscribe sensor messages using unitree_sdk2_python message types

### CycloneDDS
Install cyclonedds python package following this [tutorial](https://cyclonedds.io/docs/cyclonedds-python/latest/intro.html).

Some basic commands:
 - `cyclonedds ps`: show all messages
 - `cyclonedds typeof <topic_name>`: check topic types
 - `cyclonedds subscribe <topic_name>: susbcribe topic

### subscribe LiDAR pointcloud
use built-in python message type PointCloud2_

### subscribe IMU data
use built-in python message type IMUState

## Cross-machine Communication
We need to setup cross-machine communication when we need other types of ports (e.g., I2C) since B2W only provides typeC ports. 

Here we show how to setup a three machine (PC5, Jetson, and desktop) communication using ethernet and wireless connection. PC5 is connected with Jetson through ethernet, PC5 is connected with desktop through wireless network.

We have PC5 running SLAM with ethernet address `192.168.123.166` and wifi ip address `192.168.85.2`, a jetson with ethernet address `192.168.123.222`, and a desktop PC with wifi address `192.168.85.3`. 

| PC      | Function            | Interface | IP Address         |
|:--------|:--------------------|:----------|:-------------------|
| PC5     | SLAM + ROS Master   | Ethernet  | `192.168.123.166`  |
|         |                     | Wi‑Fi     | `192.168.85.2`     |
| Jetson  | Sensor Data         | Ethernet  | `192.168.123.222`  |
| Desktop | Monitoring          | Wi‑Fi     | `192.168.85.3`     |

### enable PC5 IP forwarding
PC5 needs to route traffic between Jetson and desktop:
```bash
echo "net.ipv4.ip_forward=1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
```

### enable communication between Jetson and desktop
Desktop can’t reach Jetson directly, so route via PC5's Wi-Fi IP:
```bash
sudo ip route add 192.168.123.0/24 via 192.168.85.2 dev wlan0 onlink
```

> Replace wlan0 with the actual interface if different (ip a to check)

### ROS Environment Variables
Assume PC5 is the ROS Master. You must set the same ROS_MASTER_URI and the correct ROS_IP on each machine.

On PC5,
```bash
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.123.166:11311
export ROS_IP=192.168.123.166
roscore
```

On Jetson,
```bash
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.123.166:11311
export ROS_IP=192.168.123.222
```

On desktop,
```bash
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.123.166:11311
export ROS_IP=192.168.85.3
```

> Add these lines to each ~/.bashrc for convenience.

### test
ping each other in each machine.
