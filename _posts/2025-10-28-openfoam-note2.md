## CFD background
### incompressible fluid

#### Reynolds number
The Reynolds number (\(Re\)) is a dimensionless quantity in fluid dynamics that 
predicts fluid flow patterns by comparing inertial forces to viscous forces. 
A low Reynolds number indicates laminar flow, which is smooth and orderly, 
while a high Reynolds number suggests turbulent flow, which is chaotic and complex.
Reynolds number is calculated as the ratio of fliud velocity and density to viscosity.
